> A simple Chrome and Firefox extension that changes the stylings of code blocks on pages you visit

## What is it?
CodeText is a website that will generate a custom Chrome or Firefox extension that changes the way code blocks look on the pages that you visit, making them look more like the editor you use on your computer.
