> A simple Chrome and Firefox extension that changes the stylings of code blocks on pages you visit

## What is it?
CodeText is a website that will generate a custom Chrome or Firefox extension that changes the way code blocks look on the pages that you visit, making them look more like the editor you use on your computer.


## Where can I get it?
CodeText is still in development, but in the meantime, you can see what's happening. Also, feel free to contribute or open an issue if you have any questions.
