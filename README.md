1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/ssight/CodeText/releases/) section and download the `.zip` file and extract it to a new folder.

2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome and turn on the `developer mode` switch in the top right corner.

3. Click on the new `Load unpacked` button and choose the folder where you've extracted CodeText to

### Method 2 (might work)
âš  This may not work and is not recommended. Do this only if you can't use the first method for some reason.

2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome and turn on the`developer mode` switch in the top right corner.

# FAQ

## Help! I can't see a difference.
It's likely that you haven't configured CodeText to how you want it. Follow the instructions below:

## Ok then, how do I customise the code blocks?
1. Click on the CodeText icon in the top right hand corner and click `Options`

2. Change whichever values you like. Make sure to put the units, for example `3px` or `2vw`. For padding, you can specify multiple values for the top and bottom and for the sides. For example `5px 10px` would apply `5px` to the top and the bottom and `10px` to sides.

3. Click on the `Preview and check for errors` button to see how the code block will look.

4. Click the `Save your settings` button to, well `save your settings`
