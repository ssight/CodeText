# CodeText
> A simple Chrome and Firefox extension that changes the stylings of code blocks on pages you visit

## What is it?
CodeText is a website that you visit that will generate a custom Chrome or Firefox extension that changes the way code blocks look on the pages that you visit, making them look more like the editor you use

## Where can I get it?
You can get it soon, but for now, CodeText is still under development. In the meantime, feel free to contribute or open an issue :)
