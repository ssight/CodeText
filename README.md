# CodeText
> A Chrome extension that changes the stylings of code blocks on pages you visit

## What is it?
CodeText is an extension that changes the way code blocks look on pages that you visit, making them look more like the editor you use on your computer. It allows for more confortable and uniform reading experience.

## Where can I get it?
CodeText will (hopefully) soon be on the Chrome Web Store, but you can also download it from the 'releases' branch. Just make sure to sideload it as a developer extension.
